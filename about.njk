<h1>About The Team</h1>
<h2>Brice Stratford</h2>
<p>Brice is a performer, novelist, storyteller and theatre-maker. He is the actor-manager of The Owle Schreame Theatre company, which spent several years before the pandemic exploring performance practices in historic English theatre. His research was focussed on the interregnum Drolls, which were performed illegally during the Commonwealth. In addition to several successful theatrical productions, his research gained him an MA from the Shakespeare Institute, University of Birmingham. In 2022 he released two books - New Forest Myths and Folklore (The History Press), and Anglo Saxon Mythology: The Struggle For The Seven Kingdoms (Batsford) - with a third (Halloween Folklore) scheduled for release in 2024, and several more planned.</p>
